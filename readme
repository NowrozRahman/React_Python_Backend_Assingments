Challenges Faced
Initial Setup and Data Loading:

Loading and displaying JSON data in a React table required careful handling of asynchronous data fetching and state updates.
Ensuring that the data was correctly formatted and displayed in a user-friendly manner.

Backend Integration:

Setting up the Fastapi backend and ensuring it correctly handled CRUD operations was initially challenging.
Configuring CORS to allow the React frontend to communicate with the Flask backend took some troubleshooting.
